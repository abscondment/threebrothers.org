I was thinking about the phase "The exception that proves the rule" the other
day, and it made little sense to me. I was hoping to discover it being similar
to [eat your cake and have it too](http://wsu.edu/~brians/errors/eatcake.html),
*i.e.* possessing a normal and reasonable original meaning, but being commonly
used in a nonsensical manner.

To prove something can mean to test it and try it, as in *proving ore*. I hoped
that this sense of the word was part of the original meaning, but that [appears
to not be the case](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_that_proves_the_rule).
