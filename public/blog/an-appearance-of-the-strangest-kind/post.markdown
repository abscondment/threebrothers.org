Given my current time constraints, a single cogent blog post would
constitute a strange enough appearance. But I have something rarer and
more fascinating in store for you, Dear Reader:

I'll be giving [a talk at this year's StrangeLoop](https://thestrangeloop.com/sessions)!

I'm *incredibly* excited about this. I'll be speaking on using Mirah
for Android development &ndash; something I've
[written about](../implementing-a-lazy-loading-android-gallery-with-mirah/)
a little bit in [the past](../experimenting-with-mirah-for-android/).

I attended last year, and found the conference quite excellent. This
year promises to be even better, with keynotes from Rich Hickey
(creator of Clojure), [Gerald Sussman](http://www-mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/) (!), and more. The caliber of
the other talks looks incredible, and I'm really honored to be
included.

So, grab a ticket before the prices go up, and come watch me
fumble difficult questions about the JVM!
