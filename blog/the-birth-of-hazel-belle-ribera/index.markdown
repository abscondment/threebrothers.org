On December 20, 2011, Hazel Belle Ribera was born!

We had another great home birth with our [wonderful midwives](http://www.midwifeseattle.com/). Jessica was amazing, to say the least.

Hazel is a great little girl, and so snuggly. At 7lbs 5oz and 21.25", she's the lightest and longest of the bunch. She takes after her mother in that way.

I won't write quite so much as I did [for Ivo's birth](../the-birth-of-ivo-clark-ribera/), but not because the experience was lesser. Labor was longer and less obvious this time, but we had good friends and a warm fire to keep us company.

The boys both love her, and love to hold her. They're so tender and sweet together; we feel really blessed.
